## Hi there 👋

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Dublin with a Master’s in Electronics & Computer Engineering from UCD. I build production-ready web applications across frontend, backend, and deployment using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

I’ve developed scalable REST APIs, implemented authentication systems, containerized services with Docker, and optimized performance in real-world projects, including a power-grid visualization platform modeling 500+ nodes.

Currently seeking a graduate/junior software engineering role where I can contribute to building reliable, scalable systems.
